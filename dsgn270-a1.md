# What's To Love About Pinterest

## Pinterest's Usability
Pinterest is an excellent example of intuitive navigation by being incredibly user friendly and easy to navigate without issues or complications. This is due to three major factors.

1. A very simple yet effective design that is clearly laid out for the user
2. Not needing much brain power to find what you are looking for
3. Having a vastly broad range of search results

This site mostly follows in the normality in terms of conventions. It implements a card pattern design and is *very effective* in doing so. For the purpose of this site specifically, it works out perfectly in giving users a wide view of options.

Pinterest is a rather narrow and deep in terms of navigation. However, they do a good job of not making it appear as narrow to the user due to the fact you typically will be able to find what you are looking for within the first few clicks.

Although the main purpose of Pinterest is to provide the user with a wide range of photos, they do an effective job of making all the text clear and easily viewable for the user.
>An example would be how a highlighted background is provided when you hover above an image to display any text that may be associated with the image.

## Pinterest Dominates Visual Hierarchy
The first overall impression of this site is that it contains a lot of information all at once, but it is not overwhelming to the user, due to the simplicity of it's design.

This is one of the most simple yet effective sites in terms of quick and easy browsing given how easily scannable the site is. It typically gives the user hundreds of visual images they could be in search of within seconds.

In terms of **Visual Hierarchy** they do a great job of implementing the following:

- Size and Scale - The size of the images are always kept large enough that it is always clear to the user.
- Rule of Odds - The desktop site typically shows five images across horizontally keeping the user's attention.
- Repetition - The site always has a cohesiveness about the display of images regardless of content.

However users will notice on the mobile site and app, that Pinterest does not follow the *Rule of Odds* principle. This is due to the smaller screen size and they tend to displays images across horizontally in groups of two.

## Pinterest is Better on the App
The mobile website is not the easiest to use for Pinterest due to the small size. The app has made it easier for users to navigate and browse as they please. Specifically, having no cursor allows the user to scan and scroll much faster by using their thumbs.

The app also takes advantage of the fact that the *most* mobile devices include a **built-in camera**. This allows users to take photo's on the spot and upload them whenever and wherever they please. Making the app much more convenient for on-the-go use.

Both the desktop site and the app make excellent use of the card pattern, so does the mobile website however again it is not as easy on the eyes. Also the mobile site has a tendency to be much slower than the desktop site or app making them more favourable.

## Overall Critique
Overall it is very clear to see why so many individuals choose and continue to use Pinterest as a browser for images. It is user friendly, well-designed, unproblematic, and provides the user almost always with exactly what they are looking for.

Pinterest is an excellent search resource and has rightfully earned it is place in terms of image search engines. The only major drawback that can be taken from Pinterest is that there are no parental controls making some content sensitive for certain viewers.

Therefore parents would want to take a second look before allowing their child to use the site, the age restriction is 13+ so it is not very worrying to most people, in terms of what content might be displayed, but it is **important** to note the possible risks associated.

They do an excellent job of monitoring the site and reviewing sensitive content before it may be viewed by someone who could be affected by it.
